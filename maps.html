            <h3>Rebirth Island<br>
            Estimated Wins: 20+</h3>
        <p>Rebirth Island. The current stomping grounds for the Bounty-Boys. This is the most recent map to be featured in the Resurgence Quads Playlist. Upon first addition, the map garnered mixed reviews. The Bounty-Boys had been in top form on "Fortunes Keep" at the time of the maps release, and thus the change was met with skepticism. No excuses were made though, The Bounty-Boys quickly adapted to the change in terrain and in no time found themselves setting record high bounty completion rates. As it stands, this is the preferred map of the team.</p>

            <h3>Ashika Island<br>
            Estimated Wins: 10+</h3>
        <p>Ashika Island, an oriental-themed map, was not particularly popular among the team. When Liam "The Kid" Cusak was asked his opinion on the map, he gave a very insightful response, which in many ways sums up the problems the map faced... "Wait, when was there a Japanese map?". When indeed. A forgettable moment in an otherwise remarkable gaming experience.</p>

            <h3>Fortunes Keep<br>
            Estimated Wins: 30+</h3>
        <p> Fortunes Keep is an exceptional map that quickly became a timeless favorite among players. Its diverse terrain offers a thrilling and dynamic gameplay experience, with strategic opportunities at every turn. The keep at the heart of the map adds tons of excitement, serving as a focal point for intense battles. This map truly elevated our gaming experience to new heights, pushing us to unleash our full potential. Additionally, the other map, which stands as our most triumphant or second most triumphant.</p>

        <div class="panel" style="background-image: url(assets/Images/Vondel.webp)">
            <h3>Vondel<br>
            Estimated Wins: ~10</h3>
         <p>The map "Vondel" stands out with its predominantly urban landscape, characterized by a plethora of buildings and rivers. The fighting style on this map diverges significantly from others, as the close-quarter combat within the cityscape demands a heightened sense of awareness and precision. However, despite its distinct features, "Vondel" has garnered a reputation as the least favored map among players, perhaps due to the challenges it presents or personal preferences for other environments.</p>
